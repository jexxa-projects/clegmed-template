## Start Developing your Project

### Set up your project on GitHub

To continuously build and deploy your application, we recommend using GitHub as described [here](README-GitHub.md).

### Package Structure
To organize our code, we recommend the following package structure. Since messages are treated as first-class objects, we strongly recommend a fine-grained packages structure:



``` 
(src)
    flowgraph // Provides app specific flow graphs 
        |    contract         // Data structures used between filters
        |    error            // Exceptions or error structs occurred during processing
        
    plugins   // Provides app specific filter 
    |    <technology 1>
    |    ...
    |    <technology n>
    dto
        |    consumedmessage  // Messages received by the app
        |    publishedmessage // Messages published by the app
        |    domainevent      // Domain events published by the app
        |    telemetrydata    // Telemetry data published by the app
 
```


### Cleanup Readme

After successfully setting up your new project, you should clean up the text of README as described [here](https://www.makeareadme.com)
